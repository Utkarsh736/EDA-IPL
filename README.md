## Indian Premier League

Throughout the years the teams have shuffled a bit here and there 
for eg. 
- In 2011 two teams Kochi Tuskers Kerela and Pune Warriors India were added but later got discarded.
- In 2016 two teams Rising Pune SuperGiants and Gujurat Lions were added as a replacement to Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals that got banned.
